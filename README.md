# Ludum Dare 50 - Flower Power

Heyho, my name is H4zz4rdDev and I created this game for the LD50 game jam. All assets are selfmade and no Unity asset store package was used.

### Story 
You are farmer!

As a farmer you know that there is one inevitable thing that you can´t avoid! Bad weed! Bad weed will always grow anywhere, unless you do your best and start farming sunflowers on your farm! :-)

You delay the inevitable by watering your land and growing sunflowers. Bad weed will only grow again, if you don´t have a sunflower on your farm or you don´t water your farm. If the bad weed grows until it reaches your water pipe, the pipe will be destroyed and you lose the fight against nature.

### Controls
```
W – climb up & turn to plant/chest
A – walk left
S – climb down
D – walk right
Space key – farm plant / turn on water / turn off water / sell bad weed and sunflowers
```
